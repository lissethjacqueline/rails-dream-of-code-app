### Q1-What tables do you need to add? Decide on table names and their associations to each other and any existing tables/models.
**Topics**
- has_many :Lesson_topics
- has_many :Lessons, through: :Lesson_topics
**lesson_topics**
- belongs_to :lesson
- belongs_to :topic
**Lessons**
- has_many :Lesson_topics
- has_many :topics, through: :lesson_topics

### Q2-What columns are necessary for the associations you decided on?
- "lesson_topics" needs: "lesson_id", "topic_id"  
- "topics" needs: "id", "title"

### Q3-What other columns (if any) need to be included on the tables? What other data needs to be stored?
- "topics": add "created_at" and "updated_at" (timestamps).  
- "lesson_topics": add "created_at" and "updated_at" (timestamps).  
- Add indexes  

### Q4-Write out each table's name and column names with data types.
**topics**  
  - id: integer (PK)  
  - title: string, null: false, unique  
  - created_at: datetime  
  - updated_at: datetime  

**lesson_topics**  
  - id: integer (PK)  
  - lesson_id: integer, null: false, FK → lessons.id  
  - topic_id: integer, null: false, FK → topics.id  
  - created_at: datetime  
  - updated_at: datetime 

### Q5-Determine the generator command you'll need to create the migration file and run the command to generate
### the empty migration file. Start with just the topics migration. (Hint: your filename should be create_topics)
- To create the "Topic" migration :
    bin/rails generate migration (places the name_of_the_topics here w/o the "()")
